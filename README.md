# VanishPad

**VanishPad** is an ephemeral text editor for MacOS.

## Overview

**VanishPad** is a unique and aggressively simple text editor for MacOS.

You **can't save** your work in VanishPad. Once you close the window, your writing is **gone forever**.

## Why?

I created VanishPad as a personal tool for jotting things down or getting things off my chest. Sometimes it's just nice to have a place to write something inconsequential down.

- No barriers.
- No prompt to create a document.
- No prompt to save a document.

Just a place to edit text (momentarily).

## Requirements

You'll need the following to build & run VanishPad:

- A Mac running MacOS 12+
- swift
- XCode Command Line Tools

## Build instructions

1. Clone the repo to your machine.
2. Navigate to the repo: `cd ~/Documents/GitHub/VanishPad`
3. Build the app with the included script: `swift build.swift`
